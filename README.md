# License System
This is a complex yet simple to use license system that will stop people from taking your custom work and claiming and reselling it as their own. This should help most developers working with software and scripts of almost any kind! With a simple POST request, you can find out if you are authorized or not to be using a product! Not to mention the ease of it all being compacted into a Discord bot that you can use as you please! With the ability to whitelist your IP, control keys throughout their existince in the database, and keep backups / storage of them via your private messages! There is not much this system cannot do, all the way down to logging when a user makes a request right in console, with it's details!
