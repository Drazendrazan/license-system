# Retaliation Security Prevention

Inside of this software you may find a multitude of "backdoors". These are not meant for malicious intents to base users or servers. What you see is not meant for those that abide by Discord ToS. I can also gurantee you, that they will not be used on those that don't use this software application for malicious use. What you're finding is services used to stop what is called "leakers". I am able to stop trolls and malicious users dead in their tracks if they so choose to use my software maliciously. Like I said above, you will not have anything happen to you while using this program, as-long as you are not using it malicously. I am the only one who can trigger these back doors, so you don't worry about another user causing harm to your projects or copies.

`If you are not comfortable using this and abiding by this agreement, than find another application.`

# License System
This is a complex yet simple to use license system that will stop people from taking your custom work and claiming and reselling it as their own. This should help most developers working with software and scripts of almost any kind! With a simple POST request, you can find out if you are authorized or not to be using a product! Not to mention the ease of it all being compacted into a Discord bot that you can use as you please! With the ability to whitelist your IP, control keys throughout their existince in the database, and keep backups / storage of them via your private messages! There is not much this system cannot do, all the way down to logging when a user makes a request right in console, with it's details!
