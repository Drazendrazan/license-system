# Notice

- The API will handle itself just fine, we recommend not editing it, as it was coded in a way that will work for a very long time.
- The `502.html` file you see, we also recommend highly you DO NOT EDIT, it is setup to stop leakers from accessing your system when the website is down, and exploiting it.
- Configurable API Options can be found in the `config.js` file back a folder.
